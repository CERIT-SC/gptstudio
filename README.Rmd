The goal of gptstudio is for R programmers to easily incorporate use of large language models (LLMs) into their project workflows. These models appear to be a step change in our use of text for knowledge work, but you should carefully consider ethical implications of using these models.

For further addins, tailored for R developers, also see the sister package: [gpttools](https://jameshwade.github.io/gpttools/)

## Install the addins from this package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("gptstudio")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of this package from GitHub.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("MichelNivard/gptstudio")
```

## Privacy Notice for gptstudio

This privacy notice is applicable to the R package that uses popular language models like gpt-4 turbo and claude-2.1. By using this package, you agree to adhere to the privacy terms and conditions set by the API service.

### Data Sharing with AI Services

When using this R package, any text or code you highlight/select with your cursor, or the prompt you enter within the built-in applications, will be sent to the selected AI service provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, Google AI Studio, Azure OpenAI) as part of an API request. This data sharing is governed by the privacy notice, rules, and exceptions that you agreed to with the respective service provider when creating an account.

### Security and Data Usage by AI Service Providers

We cannot guarantee the security of the data you send via the API to any AI service provider, nor can we provide details on how each service processes or uses your data. However, these providers often state that they use prompts and results to enhance their AI models, as outlined in their terms of use. Be sure to review the terms of use of the respective AI service provider directly.

### Limiting Data Sharing

The R package is designed to share only the text or code that you specifically highlight/select or include in a prompt through our built-in applications. No other elements of your R environment will be shared unless you turn those features on. It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not accidentally share sensitive data with any AI service provider.

**IMPORTANT: To maintain the privacy of your data, do not highlight, include in a prompt, or otherwise upload any sensitive data, code, or text that should remain confidential.**

## Getting Started with OpenAI

1.  Make an OpenAI account. [Sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/).

2.  [Create an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use with the package.

3.  Set the API key up in Rstudio. See the section below on configuring the API key.

### Configuring OpenAI API Key

To interact with the OpenAI API, it's required to have a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Here are the steps to configure it.

You can establish this environment variable globally by including it in your project's .Renviron file. This approach ensures that the environment variable persists across all sessions as the Shiny app runs in the background.

Here is a set of commands to open the .Renviron file for modification:

```{r}
#| eval: false
require(usethis)
edit_r_environ()
```

If you wish to set the variable temporarily for a single session, use this command, substituting `"<APIKEY>"` with your actual OpenAI API key:

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<APIKEY>")
```

For a persistent setting that loads every time you launch this project, add the following line to .Renviron, replacing `"<APIKEY>"` with your actual API key:

``` bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="<APIKEY>"
```

**Caution:** If you're using version control systems like GitHub or GitLab, remember to include .Renviron in your .gitignore file to prevent exposing your API key!

**Important Note:** OpenAI API will not function without valid payment details entered into your OpenAI account. This is a restriction imposed by OpenAI and is unrelated to this package.

## Usage

Some examples of use.

### Chat in RStudio

1.  **Addins \> gptstudio \> Chat**
2.  Type your question.
3.  Click “Send” button or press "Enter"
4.  Ask more questions
5.  Copy and try code

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6314313/252512856-7f677852-f2c8-4d7c-a2b6-ca909caaa142.mov" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6314313/252512856-7f677852-f2c8-4d7c-a2b6-ca909caaa142.mov" controls="controls" muted="muted" class="d-block rounded-bottom-2 border-top width-fit" style="max-height:640px; min-height: 200px; max-width:700px">
</video>

The Chat addin supports internationalization. You can set the "GPTSTUDIO_LANGUAGE" environmental variable to the language of your preference (i.e. `GPTSTUDIO_LANGUAGE="es"` for spanish). See the full list of supported languages in the translation file (`"inst/translations/translation.json"`).

#### Using Other Models

We're excited to announce that our service now includes models from HuggingFace's inference API, Anthropic's claude models, and Google's AI Studio, Azure OpenAI, and local models with Ollama broadening the range of AI solutions you can use. You can set the model using the setting (gear) button in the Chat addin app.

#### Persistent User Settings & Custom Prompt

You can now save your app settings across sessions. These are saved in a user config file. The easiest way to change these settings is the "Save as Default" button in the add-in app. This also allows you to specify your own custom prompt to pass to the model as instructions.

### Provide your own instructions in R, R Markdown, or Quarto files

**Addins \> GPTSTUDIO \> Chat in Source:** Apply any edit what YOU desire or can dream up to a selection of code or text.

### Spelling ang grammar check

**Addins \> GPTSTUDIO \> Spelling and Grammar:** Takes the selected text sends it to OpenAI's best model and instructs it to return a spelling and grammar checked version.
