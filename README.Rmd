The goal of gptstudio is for R programmers to easily incorporate use of large language models (LLMs) into their project workflows. These models appear to be a step change in our use of text for knowledge work, but you should carefully consider ethical implications of using these models. Ethics of LLMs (also called [Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)) is an area of very active discussion.

## Prerequisites

1. Make an OpenAI account. As of now, the free one will do.

2. [Create an OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to use `{openai}` package within Rstudio

3. Set the API key up in Rstudio in one of two ways:
  - By default, functions of `{openai}` will look for `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. If you want to set a global environment variable, you can use the following command, where `"<APIKEY>"` should be replaced with your actual key:

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>")
```

  - Alternatively, you can set the key in your .Renviron file.

Otherwise, you can add the key to the .Renviron file of the project. The following commands will open .Renviron for editing:

```{r}
#| eval: false
require(usethis)
edit_r_environ(scope = "project")
```

You can add the following line to the file (again, replace xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual key):

```{.bash}
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This now set the API key every time you start up this particular project. Note: If you are using GitHub/Gitlab, do not forget to add .Renviron to .gitignore!

## Install the addins from this package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
require(devtools)
install_github("MichelNivard/GPTstudio")
```

## Usage

Some examples of use.
 
### Spelling ang grammar check

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Spelling and Grammar:** Takes the selected text sends it to OpenAI's best model and instructs it to return a spelling and grammar checked version.

### Active voice

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Change text to active voice:** Takes the selected text, sends it to OpenAI's best model and instructs it to return the text in  the active voice.

#### Write/code from prompt

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Write/Code from prompt:** Takes the selected text and sends it to OpenAI as a prompt for the model to work with. This is most like the ChatGPT experience.

Text from prompt:

Code from prompt:

![prompt_code](./media/prompt_code.gif)


### Comment your code: 

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Comment your code:** Takes the selected text sends it to OpenAI as a prompt for a code specific model to work with, asks for a version with a comment added explaining the code line by line.

### Provide your own instructions

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Freeform GPT editor:** Apply any edit what YOU desire or can dream up to a selection of code or text.

**Privacy note:** these functions work by taking the text or code you have highlighted/selected with the cursor and send these to OpenAI as part of a prompt, they fall under their privacy notice/rules/exceptions you agreed to with OpenAI when making an account. I do not know how secure these are when sent to OpenAI, I also don't know what OpenAI does with them. The code is designed to ONLY share the highlighted/selected text and no other elements of your R environment (i.e. data) unless you have highlighted it when running the addin. This may limit usability for now, but I do not want people to accidentally share sensitive data with OpenAI.


DO NOT HIGHLIGHT, AND THEREFORE UPLOAD, DATA/CODE/TEXT THAT SHOULD REMAIN PRIVATE
