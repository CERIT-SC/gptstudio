The goal of GPTstudio is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of GPTstudio from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MichelNivard/GPTstudio")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gptstudio)
## basic example code
```

GPT addins for Rstudio, **read the privacy note at the bottom, this is alpha software there is no warranty for anything.**

### Prerequisite

1. make and openai.com account (free one will do for now)

2. generate an API key to use openai from Rstudio: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

3. set the API key up in Rstudio in one of two ways:

By default, functions of openai will look for OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. If you want to set a global environment variable, you can use the following command (where xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx should be replaced with your actual key):

```
Sys.setenv(
    OPENAI_API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
)
```

Otherwise, you can add the key to the .Renviron file of the project. The following commands will open .Renviron for editing:

```
if (!require(usethis))
    install.packages("usethis")

usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "project")
You can add the following line to the file (again, replace xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual key):


OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Thios now set the API key every time you start up this particular project. Note: If you are using GitHub/Gitlab, do not forget to add .Renviron to .gitignore!


## install the addins from this package:

simply install:

```
require(devtools)
install_github("MichelNivard/GPTstudio")
```

## useage:

 Some examples of use.
 
### Spelling ang grammar check

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Spelling and Grammar:** Takes the selected text sends it to openai's best model and instructs it to return a spelling and grammar checked version.

### Active voice:

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Change text to active voice:** Takes the selected text sends it to openai's best model and instructs it to return the text in  the active voice. 

![active_voice](./media/active_voice.gif)

#### Write/code from prompt

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Write/Code from prompt:** Takes the selected text sends it to openai's as a prompt for the model to work with, this is most like the ChatGPT experience.

Text from prompt:

![prompt_text](./media/promt_text.gif)

Code from prompt:

![prompt_code](./media/prompt_code.gif)


### Comment your code: 

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Comment your code:** Takes the selected text sends it to openai's as a prompt for a code specific model to work with, asks for a versino with a comment added explainign the code line by line. 

![add comments to code](./media/comments.gif)

### Apply any edit YOU desire or can dream up:

**Addins > GPTSTUDIO > Freeform GPT editor:** Apply any edit YOU desire or can dream up to a selection of code or text.

**Privacy note:** these functions work by taking the text or code you have highlighted/selected with the cursor and send these to openai as part of a prompt, they fall under their privacy notice/rules/exceptions you agreed to with openai when making an account. I do not know how secure thesse are when send to openai, I also don't know what openai does with them. The code is designed to ONLY share the highlighted/selected text and no other elements of your R environment (i.e. data) unless you have highlighted it when running the addin. This may limit usability for now, but I dont want people to eccidentally send sensitive data to openai over the internet. 

DO NOT HIGHLIGHT, AND THEREFORE UPLOAD, DATA/CODE/TEXT THAT SHOULD REMAIN PRIVATE.
